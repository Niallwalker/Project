# Project
This is my Java/Git Hub Project
Over the easter break, I had to do 2 Java exercises.
The first one was known as Convert and it consisted of a program converted a number from celsius to fahrenheit and anothe program which converted fahrenheit to celsius.
I did this by creating an index called convert and then I made 2 seperate programs called ConvertFTC and ConvertCTF. 
I used the Program.main(null); line of code to link all the programs together.
The next programm was a search program. Like the searchstudet progra I did, this was alittle more complicated but easy to make changes to. I used the System.println to designate each title we needed and I created a String caled dataSet which had all the info I needed.
